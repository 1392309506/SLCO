Question:
If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn left. Turn left. Take 6 steps. Take 3 steps. Turn around. Take 1 step. Take 3 steps. Take 5 steps.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer:
Let's analyze the movements step by step to determine if we return to the starting point:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin our journey at the origin (0, 0).
2. **Turn Left**: This changes our facing direction, but we remain at the same position (0, 0).
3. **Turn Left**: We turn again, now facing the opposite direction, but still at (0, 0).
4. **Take 6 Steps**: We move in the direction we are facing (which is now the opposite of our original direction) to (0, 6).
5. **Take 3 Steps**: Continuing in the same direction, we reach (0, 9).
6. **Turn Around**: We now face the original direction we started with.
7. **Take 1 Step**: Moving in the original direction, we arrive at (0, 8).
8. **Take 3 Steps**: Continuing in the same direction, we move to (0, 5).
9. **Take 5 Steps**: Finally, we move to (0, 0).

After this comprehensive analysis, we confirm that we have returned to the starting point.

Question:
If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 6 steps backward. Take 8 steps left. Take 3 steps right. Take 7 steps forward. Take 3 steps right. Take 9 steps right. Take 1 step backward. Take 7 steps left.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer:
Let's analyze the movements step by step to determine if we return to the starting point:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin our journey at the origin (0, 0).
2. **Take 6 steps backward**: Moving backward means we go down the y-axis. This takes us to (0, -6).
3. **Take 8 steps left**: Moving left means we go along the negative x-axis. This brings us to (-8, -6).
4. **Take 3 steps right**: Moving right means we go along the positive x-axis. This takes us to (-5, -6).
5. **Take 7 steps forward**: Moving forward means we go up the y-axis. This brings us to (-5, 1).
6. **Take 3 steps right**: Moving right again takes us to (-2, 1).
7. **Take 9 steps right**: Continuing to move right, we reach (7, 1).
8. **Take 1 step backward**: Moving backward means we go down the y-axis, which takes us to (7, 0).
9. **Take 7 steps left**: Finally, moving left brings us back to (0, 0).

After carefully analyzing the entire sequence, we conclude that we have indeed returned to our starting point.

Question:
If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 7 steps left. Take 2 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 3 steps forward.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer:
Let's analyze the movements step by step to determine if we return to the starting point:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin our journey at the origin (0, 0).
2. **Take 7 steps left**: We move to (-7, 0), shifting our position leftward.
3. **Take 2 steps backward**: This moves us to (-7, -2), descending vertically.
4. **Take 7 steps backward**: Continuing backward takes us to (-7, -9).
5. **Take 7 steps backward**: We venture further back to (-7, -16).
6. **Take 3 steps forward**: Finally, we move back up to (-7, -13).

Based on this detailed analysis, we conclude that we do not return to the starting point.
