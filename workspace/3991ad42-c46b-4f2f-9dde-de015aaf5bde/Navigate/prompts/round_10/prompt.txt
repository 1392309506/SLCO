Question 1

If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 7 steps left. Take 2 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 3 steps forward.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer 1

Let's analyze the movements step by step to determine if we return to the starting point:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin our journey at the origin (0, 0).
2. **Take 7 steps left**: We move to (-7, 0), shifting our position leftward.
3. **Take 2 steps backward**: This moves us to (-7, -2), descending vertically.
4. **Take 7 steps backward**: Continuing backward takes us to (-7, -9).
5. **Take 7 steps backward**: We venture further back to (-7, -16).
6. **Take 3 steps forward**: Finally, we move back up to (-7, -13).

Based on this detailed analysis, we conclude that we do not return to the starting point.

Final Answer:
<answer>No</answer>

Question 2

If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn left. Turn left. Take 6 steps. Take 3 steps. Turn around. Take 1 step. Take 3 steps. Take 5 steps.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer 2

Let’s break down the movements with careful consideration:

1. **Starting Point**: Assume our initial position is point A (0, 0).
2. **Turn Left**: This reorients our direction, but we remain at the same position.
3. **Turn Left**: We turn again, now facing the opposite direction.
4. **Take 6 Steps**: We move up in this new direction to (0, 6).
5. **Take 3 Steps**: Continuing upward, we reach (0, 9).
6. **Turn Around**: We now face downward.
7. **Take 1 Step**: Moving down, we arrive at (0, 8).
8. **Take 3 Steps**: Further down to (0, 5).
9. **Take 5 Steps**: Finally, we arrive back at (0, 0).

After this comprehensive analysis, we confirm that we have returned to the starting point.

Final Answer:
<answer>Yes</answer>

Question 3

If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 6 steps backward. Take 8 steps left. Take 3 steps right. Take 7 steps forward. Take 3 steps right. Take 9 steps right. Take 1 step backward. Take 7 steps left.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer 3

Let’s explore these movements step by step:

1. **Starting Point**: We initiate our movement at (0, 0).
2. **Take 6 steps backward**: We move down to (0, -6).
3. **Take 8 steps left**: Next, we move to (-8, -6).
4. **Take 3 steps right**: This brings us to (-5, -6).
5. **Take 7 steps forward**: We shift up to (-5, 1).
6. **Take 3 steps right**: Moving to (-2, 1).
7. **Take 9 steps right**: We progress to (7, 1).
8. **Take 1 step backward**: We move down to (7, 0).
9. **Take 7 steps left**: Finally, we return to (0, 0).

After carefully analyzing the entire sequence, we conclude that we have indeed returned to our starting point.
