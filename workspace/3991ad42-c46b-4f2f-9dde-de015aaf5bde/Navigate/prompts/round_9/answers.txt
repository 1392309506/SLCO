Question:
If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 6 steps backward. Take 8 steps left. Take 3 steps right. Take 7 steps forward. Take 3 steps right. Take 9 steps right. Take 1 step backward. Take 7 steps left.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer:
Let's analyze the movements step by step to determine if we return to the starting point.

1. **Starting Point**: We begin at (0, 0).
2. **Take 6 steps backward**: Moving backward means moving in the negative y-direction. Thus, we move to (0, -6).
3. **Take 8 steps left**: Moving left means moving in the negative x-direction. We move to (-8, -6).
4. **Take 3 steps right**: Moving right means moving in the positive x-direction. We move to (-5, -6).
5. **Take 7 steps forward**: Moving forward means moving in the positive y-direction. We move to (-5, 1).
6. **Take 3 steps right**: We move to (-2, 1).
7. **Take 9 steps right**: We move to (7, 1).
8. **Take 1 step backward**: We move to (7, 0).
9. **Take 7 steps left**: We move to (0, 0).

After analyzing all the movements, we see that we have returned to the starting point (0, 0).

**Question**

If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn left. Turn left. Take 6 steps. Take 3 steps. Turn around. Take 1 step. Take 3 steps. Take 5 steps.
Options:
- Yes
- No

**Answer Analysis**

1. **Starting Point**: We begin at (0, 0).
2. **Turn Left**: This changes our direction. We are now facing left (west).
3. **Turn Left**: Now we are facing down (south).
4. **Take 6 Steps**: Move down 6 steps to (0, -6).
5. **Take 3 Steps**: Move down 3 more steps to (0, -9).
6. **Turn Around**: Now we are facing up (north).
7. **Take 1 Step**: Move up 1 step to (0, -8).
8. **Take 3 Steps**: Move up 3 steps to (0, -5).
9. **Take 5 Steps**: Move up 5 steps to (0, 0).

After following all the instructions, we have returned to the starting point (0, 0).

**Final Answer**:

Question:
If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 7 steps left. Take 2 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 3 steps forward.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer:
Let's analyze the movements step by step for the provided question:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin at (0, 0).
2. **Take 7 steps left**: Moving left means we decrease the x-coordinate. So, we move to (-7, 0).
3. **Take 2 steps backward**: Moving backward means we decrease the y-coordinate. Thus, we move to (-7, -2).
4. **Take 7 steps backward**: Again, moving backward decreases the y-coordinate further. We move to (-7, -9).
5. **Take 7 steps backward**: Continuing to move backward, we move to (-7, -16).
6. **Take 3 steps forward**: Moving forward increases the y-coordinate. We move to (-7, -13).

After analyzing all the movements, we find that the final position is (-7, -13), which is not the starting point (0, 0).
