Please carefully evaluate the following set of instructions, breaking down each movement with logical reasoning and a clear narrative. Consider the implications of each step to determine if the final position returns to the starting point. At the end of your analysis, present the final answer in the required XML format: <answer>(Yes or No)</answer>.

Question 1

If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn left. Turn left. Take 6 steps. Take 3 steps. Turn around. Take 1 step. Take 3 steps. Take 5 steps.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer 1

Let's analyze the movements step by step to determine if we return to the starting point:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin at the origin (0, 0).
2. **Turn Left**: This changes our facing direction, but we remain at (0, 0).
3. **Turn Left**: We turn again, now facing the opposite direction, still at (0, 0).
4. **Take 6 Steps**: Moving in the current direction (left), we move to (-6, 0).
5. **Take 3 Steps**: Continuing left, we move to (-9, 0).
6. **Turn Around**: Now facing right.
7. **Take 1 Step**: Moving right, we arrive at (-8, 0).
8. **Take 3 Steps**: Continuing right, we reach (-5, 0).
9. **Take 5 Steps**: Finally, we move to (0, 0).

After careful consideration of each step, we confirm that we have returned to the starting point.

Final Answer:
<answer>Yes</answer>

Question 2

If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 7 steps left. Take 2 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 3 steps forward.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer 2

Let's analyze the movements carefully:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin at (0, 0).
2. **Take 7 Steps Left**: Move to (-7, 0).
3. **Take 2 Steps Backward**: Move to (-7, -2).
4. **Take 7 Steps Backward**: Move to (-7, -9).
5. **Take 7 Steps Backward**: Move to (-7, -16).
6. **Take 3 Steps Forward**: Move to (-7, -13).

After this analysis, it’s clear that we have not returned to the starting point.

Final Answer:
<answer>No</answer>

Question 3

If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 6 steps backward. Take 8 steps left. Take 3 steps right. Take 7 steps forward. Take 3 steps right. Take 9 steps right. Take 1 step backward. Take 7 steps left.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer 3

Let’s explore these movements step by step:

1. **Starting Point**: We initiate at (0, 0).
2. **Take 6 Steps Backward**: Move to (0, -6).
3. **Take 8 Steps Left**: Move to (-8, -6).
4. **Take 3 Steps Right**: Move to (-5, -6).
5. **Take 7 Steps Forward**: Move to (-5, 1).
6. **Take 3 Steps Right**: Move to (-2, 1).
7. **Take 9 Steps Right**: Move to (7, 1).
8. **Take 1 Step Backward**: Move to (7, 0).
9. **Take 7 Steps Left**: Move to (0, 0).

After analyzing, we conclude that we have returned to our starting point.
