Question:
If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 7 steps left. Take 2 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 3 steps forward.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer:
Let's analyze the movements step by step for the provided question:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin at the origin (0, 0).
2. **Take 7 steps left**: This moves us to (-7, 0).
3. **Take 2 steps backward**: This moves us to (-7, -2).
4. **Take 7 steps backward**: We move to (-7, -9).
5. **Take 7 steps backward**: We reach (-7, -16).
6. **Take 3 steps forward**: We move to (-7, -13).

After reviewing the sequence of movements, we find that we have not returned to the starting point (0, 0). Instead, we end up at (-7, -13).

Final Answer:
<answer>No</answer>

Question:
If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 6 steps backward. Take 8 steps left. Take 3 steps right. Take 7 steps forward. Take 3 steps right. Take 9 steps right. Take 1 step backward. Take 7 steps left.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer:
Let's analyze the movements step by step for the provided instructions:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin at the origin (0, 0).
2. **Take 6 steps backward**: This moves us to (0, -6).
3. **Take 8 steps left**: Now we move to (-8, -6).
4. **Take 3 steps right**: This brings us to (-5, -6).
5. **Take 7 steps forward**: We move up to (-5, 1).
6. **Take 3 steps right**: This moves us to (-2, 1).
7. **Take 9 steps right**: We progress to (7, 1).
8. **Take 1 step backward**: Moving down, we arrive at (7, 0).
9. **Take 7 steps left**: Finally, we return to (0, 0).

Through this step-by-step analysis, we confirm we have returned to the starting point.

Final Answer:
<answer>Yes</answer>

Question:
If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn left. Turn left. Take 6 steps. Take 3 steps. Turn around. Take 1 step. Take 3 steps. Take 5 steps.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer:
Let's analyze the movements step by step for the provided instructions:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin at the origin (0, 0).
2. **Turn Left**: This changes our orientation but keeps us at (0, 0).
3. **Turn Left**: We turn again, still at (0, 0).
4. **Take 6 Steps**: Assuming we are now facing left, we move to (-6, 0).
5. **Take 3 Steps**: Continuing left, we reach (-9, 0).
6. **Turn Around**: Now facing right, we remain at (-9, 0).
7. **Take 1 Step**: Moving right, we arrive at (-8, 0).
8. **Take 3 Steps**: We move to (-5, 0).
9. **Take 5 Steps**: Finally, we move to (0, 0).

After this careful analysis, we see that we have returned to the starting point.

Final Answer:
<answer>Yes</answer>
