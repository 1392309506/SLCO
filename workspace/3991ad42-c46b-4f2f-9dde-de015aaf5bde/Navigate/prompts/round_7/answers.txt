Question:
If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 7 steps left. Take 2 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 3 steps forward.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer:
Let's analyze the movements step by step to determine if we return to the starting point:

1. **Starting Point**: Begin at (0, 0).
2. **Take 7 steps left**: Move to (-7, 0).
3. **Take 2 steps backward**: Move to (-7, -2).
4. **Take 7 steps backward**: Move to (-7, -9).
5. **Take 7 steps backward**: Move to (-7, -16).
6. **Take 3 steps forward**: Move to (-7, -13).

After evaluating each movement, we find that we end at (-7, -13), which is not the starting point (0, 0).

Final Answer:
<answer>No</answer>

Answer:
Let's evaluate the movements step by step to determine if we return to the starting point:

1. **Starting Point**: Start at (0, 0).
2. **Take 6 steps backward**: Move to (0, -6).
3. **Take 8 steps left**: Move to (-8, -6).
4. **Take 3 steps right**: Move to (-5, -6).
5. **Take 7 steps forward**: Move to (-5, 1).
6. **Take 3 steps right**: Move to (-2, 1).
7. **Take 9 steps right**: Move to (7, 1).
8. **Take 1 step backward**: Move to (7, 0).
9. **Take 7 steps left**: Move to (0, 0).

After reviewing each step, we see that we have returned to the starting point.
