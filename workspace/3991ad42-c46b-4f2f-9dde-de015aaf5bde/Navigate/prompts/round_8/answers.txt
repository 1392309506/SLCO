Question:
If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 7 steps left. Take 2 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 3 steps forward.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer:
Let’s analyze the movements step by step to determine if we return to the starting point:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin at the origin (0, 0).
2. **Take 7 steps left**: Moving left from (0, 0) takes us to (-7, 0).
3. **Take 2 steps backward**: Moving backward (downward) from (-7, 0) brings us to (-7, -2).
4. **Take 7 steps backward**: Continuing backward from (-7, -2) moves us to (-7, -9).
5. **Take 7 steps backward**: Moving backward again from (-7, -9) takes us to (-7, -16).
6. **Take 3 steps forward**: Finally, moving forward (upward) from (-7, -16) brings us to (-7, -13).

After analyzing each step, we see that our final position is (-7, -13), which is not the starting point (0, 0).

Question:
If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 6 steps backward. Take 8 steps left. Take 3 steps right. Take 7 steps forward. Take 3 steps right. Take 9 steps right. Take 1 step backward. Take 7 steps left.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer:
Let’s analyze the movements step by step to determine if we return to the starting point:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin at the origin (0, 0).
2. **Take 6 steps backward**: Moving backward means we go down the y-axis, thus we move to (0, -6).
3. **Take 8 steps left**: Now we move left along the x-axis, resulting in the position (-8, -6).
4. **Take 3 steps right**: Moving right means we are moving back along the x-axis, which brings us to (-5, -6).
5. **Take 7 steps forward**: Moving forward means we go up the y-axis, so we move to (-5, 1).
6. **Take 3 steps right**: We move right again, resulting in the position (-2, 1).
7. **Take 9 steps right**: Continuing to move right, we reach (7, 1).
8. **Take 1 step backward**: Moving backward now means we go down the y-axis, leading us to (7, 0).
9. **Take 7 steps left**: Finally, we move left along the x-axis, which brings us back to (0, 0).

After carefully analyzing each step, we see that we have returned to our starting point.

Question:
If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn left. Turn left. Take 6 steps. Take 3 steps. Turn around. Take 1 step. Take 3 steps. Take 5 steps.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer:
Let’s analyze the movements step by step to determine if we return to the starting point:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin at the origin (0, 0).
2. **Turn Left**: This changes our facing direction, but we remain at (0, 0).
3. **Turn Left**: We turn again, now facing the opposite direction, still at (0, 0).
4. **Take 6 Steps**: Moving in the current direction (which is now left), we move to (-6, 0).
5. **Take 3 Steps**: Continuing in the same direction, we move to (-9, 0).
6. **Turn Around**: We now face the opposite direction (to the right).
7. **Take 1 Step**: Moving right, we arrive at (-8, 0).
8. **Take 3 Steps**: Continuing right, we reach (-5, 0).
9. **Take 5 Steps**: Finally, we move to (0, 0).

After analyzing each step, we find that we have returned to the starting point.
