Answer 1

Let's analyze the movements step by step:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin our journey at (0, 0).
2. **Take 7 steps left**: Moving left brings us to (-7, 0).
3. **Take 2 steps backward**: This moves us to (-7, -2).
4. **Take 7 steps backward**: We continue to (-7, -9).
5. **Take 7 steps backward**: Now we are at (-7, -16).
6. **Take 3 steps forward**: Finally, we reach (-7, -13).

After this thorough analysis, we conclude that we have not returned to the starting point.

Final Answer:

Answer 2

Let’s analyze the movements step by step:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin at (0, 0).
2. **Turn Left**: We change direction but stay at (0, 0).
3. **Turn Left**: Now facing the opposite direction, we remain at (0, 0).
