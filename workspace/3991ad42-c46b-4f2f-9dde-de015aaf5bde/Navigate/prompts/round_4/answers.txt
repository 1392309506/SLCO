Question:
If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 6 steps backward. Take 8 steps left. Take 3 steps right. Take 7 steps forward. Take 3 steps right. Take 9 steps right. Take 1 step backward. Take 7 steps left.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer:
Letâ€™s analyze the movements step by step:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin at (0, 0).
2. **Take 6 steps backward**: Moving backward (downward on the y-axis) brings us to (0, -6).
3. **Take 8 steps left**: Moving left (negative x-direction) takes us to (-8, -6).
4. **Take 3 steps right**: Moving right (positive x-direction) shifts us to (-5, -6).
5. **Take 7 steps forward**: Moving forward (upward on the y-axis) brings us to (-5, 1).
6. **Take 3 steps right**: Moving right again takes us to (-2, 1).
7. **Take 9 steps right**: Continuing to move right brings us to (7, 1).
8. **Take 1 step backward**: Moving backward (downward on the y-axis) takes us to (7, 0).
9. **Take 7 steps left**: Finally, moving left brings us back to (0, 0).

After evaluating each step, we confirm that we have returned to the starting point.

Final Answer:

Question:
If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn left. Turn left. Take 6 steps. Take 3 steps. Turn around. Take 1 step. Take 3 steps. Take 5 steps.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer:
Let's analyze the movements step by step:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin at (0, 0).
2. **Turn Left**: We change direction but remain at (0, 0).
3. **Turn Left**: Now we are facing the opposite direction, still at (0, 0).
4. **Take 6 Steps**: Moving in the current direction (which is now left), we move to (-6, 0).
5. **Take 3 Steps**: Continuing left, we reach (-9, 0).
6. **Turn Around**: We now face the opposite direction (right) but remain at (-9, 0).
7. **Take 1 Step**: Moving right, we go to (-8, 0).
8. **Take 3 Steps**: Continuing right, we arrive at (-5, 0).
9. **Take 5 Steps**: Finally, moving right again, we reach (0, 0).

After evaluating each step, we see that we have returned to the starting point.

Final Answer:
<answer>Yes</answer>

Question:
If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 7 steps left. Take 2 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 7 steps backward. Take 3 steps forward.
Options:
- Yes
- No

Answer:
Let's analyze the movements step by step:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin our journey at (0, 0).
2. **Take 7 steps left**: Moving left brings us to (-7, 0).
3. **Take 2 steps backward**: This moves us to (-7, -2).
4. **Take 7 steps backward**: We continue to (-7, -9).
5. **Take 7 steps backward**: Now we are at (-7, -16).
6. **Take 3 steps forward**: Finally, we reach (-7, -13).

After this thorough analysis, we conclude that we have not returned to the starting point.

Final Answer:
